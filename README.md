# TechneCandy #1 - Houdini, The Milk Can Escape

Welcome to The Milk Can Escape Act! This is the total rewrite of the original The Milk Cannot Escape Act.

**Disclaimer:** Purely for security reasons, the milk can is NOT, repeat, is NOT filled with water, please keep that in mind, thank you!

Harry Houdini is performing his famous Milk Can Escape act. Your task is to help him escape the milk can, more precisely
you have to make Bess say: `Harry Houdini escaped!`. Or even more precisely: to get the program to execute line 28 in the
Assistant.java. Or less precisely: execute the task in the previously precisely defined `more precisely` sections.

You can only modify code that is _not_ marked with the `@CantTouchThis` annotation.
